Our mild obsession with being “first” has been eloquently woven throughout our society and inextricably linked to notions of honor and success."},{"type":"text","value":"So is it really any wonder that the beauty industry has faithfully adhered to a standard that dictates foundation shade ranges should always begin with the lightest shade, first?"},{"type":"text","value":"Out of the 122 foundation products available on Sephora or Ulta's websites that use a sequential number system to name their shades, 97% start with their lighter shades."}],"darkToLight":[{"type":"text","value":"On the surface, always numbering the lightest shades first might seem trivial, however, when coupled with the numerous microaggressions marginalized groups face, it becomes part of a larger conversation around how deeper shades, and the folks who wear them, are treated by the beauty industry at large."},{"type":"text","value":"Roughly 40% of beauty brands use a sequential numbering system to organize their foundation shades, and yet only 3% ordered their products from dark to light."}],"wrapNumbers":[{"type":"text","value":"Even if this occurrence may be seemingly “unintentional,”  it still does not minimize <strong>the impact</strong> it has on consumers of deeper hues who are trying to navigate the beauty space. Typically the foundations named first are also the ones that are more likely to be available to purchase in brick and mortar stores (as opposed to only having the option to shade match and  purchase online.)"},{"type":"text","value":"The foundations that are named first are also usually “above the fold” on a webpage or a list of shades, making them easier to find."},{"type":"text","value":"The prioritization of the lighter shades in sequence speaks to a larger conversation around the shade names themselves."},{"type":"text","value":"Another microagression we frequently observe in the beauty industry is the inclusion of the words “nude” or “natural” in foundation shade names."}],"nude":[{"type":"text","value":"As a siloed event, there is absolutely nothing wrong with describing a foundation shade as nude or natural. After all, a foundation is meant to mimic the color of your skin as closely as possible. However, there are an overwhelming amount of light foundation shades with these words in them."}],"steps":[{"text":"We found 106 shades from 71 products that contained the word “nude” in the name.","step":"all"},{"text":"If we sort the shades based on how light or dark they are, we can start to get a sense of what types of shades are considered “nude”.","step":"sort"},{"text":"The majority of shades named “nude” are clustered in the light to mid end of the shade spectrum.","step":"majority"},{"text":"You may be wondering if this is due to shade availability. There are fewer dark shades available in general, so naturally, there would be fewer called nude. Let’s see if that’s the case. Instead of looking at individual color swatches, let’s momentarily consider the overall shape these swatches create when they are arranged from dark to light.","step":"distribution"},{"text":"Now, let’s overlay that with what we expect the shape of these swatches to look like, if those 106 shades were distributed in the same way as all 6,773 swatches in our dataset. If this inconsistent naming were just a product of shade availability, we would expect to see fewer mid-range shades named “nude” and many more dark “nude” shades. This isn’t just an issue of availability but one of inconsistent naming schemes.","step":"compare"},{"text":"Of the handful of darker shades with “nude” in their name, many can be attributed to a single brand, NudeStix, which labels every shade “nude”.","step":"nudestix"},{"text":"The darkest shade that contains “nude” in its name isn’t simply called “nude”. It’s “nude mocha”. And while there are other shades with additional descriptors in their names (like “warm nude” or “nude beige”), there are only 2 other shades with food descriptors: “nude vanilla” and “nude bisque”.","step":"highlight"},{"text":"We see the same naming trends in shades called “natural”. Once again, most of the shades in this group are light, with one of the darkest shades paired with a food descriptor. Natural toffee is the <strong>only</strong> “natural” shade paired with a food name.","step":"natural"}],"postNude":[{"type":"text","value":"The persistent association of the words “nude” and “natural” with lighter complexions sends an exclusionary message - one that says only those with a certain phenotype are worthy of those terms. This instance of bias is linked to larger issues like the fight for inclusion within beauty industry innovation."},{"type":"text","value":"There is a reason why beauty services like laser hair removal are introduced to the market without first considering how they will work on deeper complexions. Or why the latest augmented reality lipstick try-on tool fails to accurately represent the true hue of a product on someone with brown skin. It's because those with darker complexions are often considered an afterthought, as evident in the numerous foundation shade range expansions that have occurred in the last few years."},{"type":"text","value":"Curiously enough,  another trend emerged as beauty brands added deeper products to their collections. What deep foundation shade names lack in “natural” descriptors, they make up for in food and drink adjectives."}],"foodIntro":[{"type":"text","value":"The black community has a sordid history of comparing skintones to inanimate objects. The infamous brown paper bag test was used to exclude women of deeper complexions out of historically black colleges for decades. Conversely, many darker skinned black people adopted a habit of complimenting each other with idioms involving delicious treats."},{"type":"text","value":"“Chocolate Drop.” “Hot Cocoa.” “Mocha Queen.”"},{"type":"text","value":"The beauty industry soon followed suit - the naming of darker shades of foundation after a food or drink is a prevalent standard. But, the fact that food qualifiers seem to be reserved exclusively for people with deeper complexions <a href=https://www.ebony.com/style/beautifully-brown-seriously-stop-calling-me-chocolate-554/>has made some become wary over time</a>."}],"drink":[{"type":"text","value":"Although being compared to your favorite delicious delight is not the worst thing in the world, the sheer volume of “Mocha,” “Latte” and “Espresso” foundations, sheds light on a general lack of creativity when it comes to the naming of brown, dark, or black makeup items."}],"food":[{"type":"text","value":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
