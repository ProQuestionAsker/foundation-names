Our mild obsession with being “first” is a framework that is eloquently weaved throughout our society and is inextricably linked to notions of honor and success. We hold people in high esteem when they are first in their field to accomplish something. We often assign the title of “lead” when promoting people to higher positions in their workplaces. We sometimes even value speed over quality, because it means that the person who is first will get the credit."},{"type":"text","value":"So is it really any wonder that the beauty industry has faithfully adhered to a standard that dictates foundation shade ranges should always begin with the lightest shade, first.
